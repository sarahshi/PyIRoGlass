def datacheck_peakdetect(x_axis, y_axis):

    """
    Check and prepare data for peak detection analysis.

    This function ensures that the input data for peak detection is in the
    correct format and that the x- and y-axis data are of equal lengths. If
    the x-axis data is not provided, it generates an x-axis as a range of
    integers with the same length as the y-axis data.

    Parameters:
        x_axis (np.ndarray or None): A 1D array containing the x-axis data or
            None if an x-axis is to be generated.
        y_axis (np.ndarray): A 1D array containing the y-axis data.

    Returns:
        Tuple containing two numpy arrays:
            x_axis (np.ndarray): The checked or generated x-axis data.
            y_axis (np.ndarray): The checked y-axis data.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the lengths of the x-axis and y-axis data do not match.

    Notes:
        This function comes from https://github.com/avhn/peakdetect. I pulled
        this for peak fitting, as the repository is no longer maintained and
        installation no longer works.

    """
    Detect local maxima and minima in a signal based on a MATLAB script
    (http://billauer.co.il/peakdet.html).

    This function identifies peaks by searching for values which are surrounded
    by lower or higher values for maxima and minima, respectively.

    Parameters:
        y_axis (list or np.ndarray): A list or 1D numpy array containing the
            signal over which to find peaks.
        x_axis (list or np.ndarray, optional): A list or 1D numpy array whose
            values correspond to the y_axis list and is used in the return to
            specify the position of the peaks. If omitted, an index of the
            y_axis is used. Defaults to None.
        lookahead (int, optional): Distance to look ahead from a peak candidate
            to determine if it is the actual peak. Defaults to 200. A good
            value might be '(samples / period) / f' where '4 >= f >= 1.25'.
        delta (float, optional): Specifies a minimum difference between a peak
            and the following points, before a peak may be considered a peak.
            Useful to hinder the function from picking up false peaks towards
            the end of the signal. To work well, delta should be set to
            delta >= RMSnoise x 5. Defaults to 0. When omitted, it can decrease
            the speed by 20%, but when used correctly, it can double the speed
            of the function.

    Returns:
        A tuple of two lists ([max_peaks, min_peaks]) containing the positive
        and negative peaks, respectively. Each element of the lists is a
        tuple of (position, peak_value). To get the average peak value,
        use: np.mean(max_peaks, 0)[1]. To unpack one of the lists into x, y
        coordinates, use: x, y = zip(max_peaks).
