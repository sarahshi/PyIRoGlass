PyIRoGlass is a Bayesian MCMC-founded Python algorithm, written in the open-source language Python3, for determining $\mathrm{H_2O}$ and $\mathrm{CO_2}$ species concentrations in the transmission FTIR spectra of basaltic to andesitic glasses. We leverage a database of naturally degassed melt inclusions and back-arc basin basalts to delineate the fundamental shape and variability of the baseline underlying the $\mathrm{CO_{3}^{2-}}$ and $\mathrm{H_2O_{m, 1635}}$ peaks, in the mid-infrared region. PyIRoGlass employs Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to fit all probable baselines and peaks, solving for best-fit parameters and capturing covariance to offer robust uncertainty estimates.

## Documentation
Read the [documentation](https://pyiroglass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a run-through of the PyIRoGlass code. 

## Run on the Cloud 
If you do not have Python installed locally or if you use a Windows computer (without Linux), please run PyIRoGlass on [VICTOR (Volcanology Infrastructure for Computational Tools and Resources)](https://hub.victorproject.org/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F) or on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SarahShi/PyIRoGlass/blob/main/PyIRoGlass_RUN_colab.ipynb). We **strongly** recommend the use of VICTOR, for significantly faster processing. 

To run PyIRoGlass on VICTOR, run the following commands in the VICTOR terminal:
```
victor setup
15 
``` 
This will create an instance of PyIRoGlass in your local working directory. 


## Run and Install Locally
Obtain a version of Python between 3.8 and 3.12 if you do not already have it installed. PyIRoGlass can be installed with one line on Mac and Linux. Open terminal and type the following:

```
pip install PyIRoGlass
```

Make sure that you keep up with the latest version of PyIRoGlass. To upgrade to the latest version of PyIRoGlass, open terminal and type the following: 

```
pip install PyIRoGlass --upgrade
```
